\begin{abstract}
Pneumonia remains a significant global health challenge, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis to reduce its high morbidity and mortality rates. This study investigates the use of pre-trained ResNet-18 architecture with transfer learning to improve pneumonia detection in chest X-ray (CXR) images. A deep learning pipeline was developed, fine-tuned using ImageNet pre-trained weights, and modified to classify binary outcomes (normal vs. pneumonia). The model was trained on a labeled dataset of 5,856 CXR images over 10 epochs using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.16\% and a test accuracy of 81.09\%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ResNet-18 in identifying pneumonia but reveal discrepancies between validation and test performance, highlighting the need for further optimization through advanced augmentation techniques and hybrid architectures to enhance generalization for clinical applications. The study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting AI-assisted diagnostic tools for pneumonia, particularly in resource-constrained settings where radiological expertise may be limited.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death globally, particularly in low-resource settings, where early diagnosis and effective treatment are often challenging. Chest X-rays (CXR) are a widely used diagnostic tool for detecting pneumonia due to their accessibility and ability to reveal the presence of lung consolidation, which is characteristic of pneumonia \cite{rajpurkar2017}.

However, the interpretation of CXR images often requires specialized expertise, which may not always be available, especially in rural and underserved regions. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has revolutionized the field of medical image analysis. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically extract hierarchical features from raw image data \cite{lecun2015}.

In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the potential of CNNs in the automated detection of pneumonia from CXR images, achieving performance levels comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, human radiologists \cite{xie2018}. Despite these advancements, the integration of CNN-based diagnostic systems into clinical practice presents several challenges. These include issues related to dataset variability, model interpretability, and the generalization of models across different populations and clinical setting \cite{liu2020}. 

Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in healthcare, such as accountability for diagnostic errors and patient privacy, need to be addressed before widespread adoption. The objective of this research is to develop a robust model for detecting pneumonia using chest X-rays and evaluate its performance. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of CNNs for automated medical diagnostics.

\section{LITERATURE REVIEW}

The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pneumonia detection in chest X-ray (CXR) images has become a rapidly evolving field of research, with numerous studies demonstrating the potential of deep learning models to surpass human radiologists in diagnostic accuracy. This section provides an overview of existing studies in the field, highlighting the major contributions and identifying areas where further research is needed.

\subsection{Deep Learning Models for Pneumonia Detection}

Rajpurkar et al. (2017) pioneered the application of deep learning for pneumonia detection in CXR images through their development of the CheXNet model. This model, based on a 121-layer CNN, was trained on over 100,000 labeled CXR images and achieved a diagnostic performance comparable to that of radiologists \cite{rajpurkar2017a}. Their findings demonstrated that CNNs could be trained to detect pneumonia with high sensitivity and specificity, emphasizing the ability of deep learning to automate and potentially improve the diagnostic process for pneumonia.

Subsequent studies have built on this foundation. For instance, Guendel et al. (2018) utilized a multi-task learning framework with DenseNet-121 to classify pneumonia subtypes and localized abnormalities, achieving an AUC of 0.93 on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset \cite{guendel2018}. Their work underscored the value of leveraging hierarchical feature representations in CNNs for nuanced diagnostic tasks.

Recent advancements have focused on optimizing model architectures for efficiency and accuracy. Howard et al. (2019) introduced MobileNet-V3, a lightweight CNN optimized for mobile devices, which achieved 92\% accuracy in pneumonia detection while reducing computational overhead \cite{howard2019}. This highlights the potential for deploying AI models in resource-constrained settings. Similarly, Huang et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid architecture combining CNNs with vision transformers (ViTs), demonstrating that ViTs could capture global contextual features in CXRs, improving detection rates for subtle consolidations \cite{huang2020}.

Transfer learning has emerged as a critical strategy for addressing limited labeled data. Irvin et al. (2019) demonstrated that models pre-trained on the CheXpert dataset, containing 224,316 CXR studies, achieved superior performance in pneumonia detection compared to models trained from scratch \cite{irvin2019}. This approach has been validated in diverse populations, including pediatric cases, where Kermany et al. (2018) achieved 96.8\% sensitivity using transfer learning with Inception-v3 \cite{kermany2018}. However, challenges persist in detecting pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, as noted by Tang et al. (2021), whose study revealed a 15\% drop in model accuracy for atypical pneumonia presentations \cite{tang2021}.

\subsection{Challenges in CNN-Based Pneumonia Detection}

Despite the significant progress in applying CNNs to pneumonia detection, several challenges remain. One such issue is the generalization of models across different datasets. Research by Wang et al. (2017) highlighted that models trained on a specific dataset may not perform well when tested on data from different institutions, due to variations in image quality, patient demographics, and other clinical factors \cite{wang2017}. Zech et al. (2018) further demonstrated that CNNs trained on single-institution datasets often learn institution-specific biases, reducing their utility in real-world deployments \cite{zech2018}. To mitigate this, recent work by Rajaraman et al. (2020) proposed federated learning frameworks that train models on distributed datasets without data sharing, improving cross-site generalization by 12\% \cite{rajaraman2020}.

Another critical challenge is class imbalance in pneumonia datasets. Studies such as Cohen et al. (2020) noted that public CXR repositories like the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset exhibit severe imbalances, with pneumonia cases representing only 3\% of the total images \cite{cohen2020}. This skews model training toward majority classes, reducing sensitivity. Techniques like synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been employed to address this. For example, Frid-Adar et al. (2018) used GANs to generate synthetic pneumonia patches, improving model sensitivity by 9\% \cite{frid-adar2018}.

Interpretability of CNN models remains a major concern. While CNNs have demonstrated impressive performance, the "black box" nature of these models makes it difficult for clinicians to trust and understand the reasoning behind the model's decisions. Shih et al. (2019) proposed using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize regions of interest in CXRs, bridging the gap between model predictions and clinical interpretation \cite{shih2019}. Building on this, Selvaraju et al. (2020) developed a multi-modal explainability framework that combines Grad-CAM with textual explanations, enhancing clinician confidence in AI diagnoses \cite{selvaraju2020}.

\subsection{Problem Identification}

While existing research has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of CNNs in detecting pneumonia from CXR images, gaps persist. First, most studies focus on binary classification (pneumonia vs. normal), neglecting clinically relevant subtypes like viral, bacterial, or aspiration pneumonia. A 2021 study by Liang et al. revealed that even state-of-the-art models struggle to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia, achieving only 68\% accuracy compared to radiologists' 82\% \cite{liang2021}.

Second, real-world validation remains inadequate. As highlighted by DeGrave et al. (2021), many models exhibit "shortcut learning," relying on non-pathological features like imaging artifacts or patient positioning rather than true pathological markers \cite{degrave2021}. This raises concerns about robustness in clinical practice.

Third, scalability in low-resource settings is understudied. While lightweight models like MobileNet show promise, their performance degrades significantly in environments with high noise levels or outdated X-ray equipment. A 2022 study by Mehta et al. in rural Indian clinics reported a 25\% drop in model accuracy compared to urban hospital tests, underscoring the need for noise-invariant architectures \cite{mehta2022}.

Finally, ethical and regulatory frameworks for AI in pneumonia diagnosis are underdeveloped. Current guidelines, such as those from the WHO (2020), lack specificity for radiological AI applications, leaving critical questions about liability and bias unaddressed \cite{who2020}. Recent work by Esteva et al. (2021) calls for standardized evaluation protocols and multi-center trials to ensure equitable model performance across demographics \cite{esteva2021}.

\section{METHODOLOGY}

\subsection{Approach}

The proposed approach for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images combines transfer learning with strategic fine-tuning of a pre-trained ResNet-18 architecture, enhanced by comprehensive data preprocessing and class imbalance mitigation techniques. This multi-stage methodology was designed to maximize diagnostic accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Three-Phase Learning Strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Feature Extraction Phase:}
\end{enumerate}

Leveraged the frozen layers of pre-trained ResNet-18 (modules 1-2) to extract universal low-level features (edges, textures) from chest X-rays, preserving knowledge gained from ImageNet while avoiding overfitting on limited medical data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Fine-Tuning Phase:}
\end{enumerate}

Gradually unfroze and retrained higher-level layers (modules 3-4) using a decaying learning rate schedule, allowing the network to adapt its feature detectors to pneumonia-specific patterns while maintaining stable training through residual connections.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Classification Phase:}
\end{enumerate}

Replaced the original classification head with a custom binary output layer, trained with class-weighted loss to handle dataset imbalance, enabling the model to learn discriminative features for normal vs. pneumonia cases.

  Architecture}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure1.png}
\caption{Model Architecture and workflow of the ResNet-18 based pneumonia detection system.}
\label{fig:model_architecture}
\end{figure}

The ResNet-18 architecture was chosen as the foundational model for this study due to its proven reliability and efficiency in image classification tasks. ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network with 18 layers, was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images spanning various categories. The use of pre-trained weights from ImageNet provides a robust starting point, enabling the model to leverage features learned from a large and diverse dataset. These pre-trained features help the model quickly adapt to the task of pneumonia detection, even with a relatively smaller dataset, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:model_architecture}.

The core innovation of ResNet-18 lies in its residual learning framework, which addresses the degradation problem in deep networks through skip connections, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:resnet18}. Traditional deep networks face challenges with vanishing gradients, where the error signal diminishes as it propagates backward through multiple layers. ResNet's skip connections create shortcut paths for gradient flow, enabling the training of deeper networks without performance degradation. Each residual block in ResNet-18 can be mathematically represented as:

y=F(x,W)+x

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{x\textbackslash mathbf\{x\}}x is the input to the residual block.
\item
  \emph{F(x,W)\textbackslash mathcal\{F\}(\textbackslash mathbf\{x\}, W)}F(x,W) represents the residual mapping, typically consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions.
\item
  \emph{WW}W denotes the weights of the convolutional layers.
\item
  The addition \emph{x+F(x,W)\textbackslash mathbf\{x\} + \textbackslash mathcal\{F\}(\textbackslash mathbf\{x\}, W)}x+F(x,W) represents the skip (shortcut) connection, allowing gradients to flow directly through the network during backpropagation.
\item
  \emph{y\textbackslash mathbf\{y\}}y is the output of the residual block, which is then passed to the next layer.
\end{itemize}

Where x is the input to the residual block, F(x, \{W\_i\}) represents the residual mapping to be learned through convolutional layers, and y is the output. This formulation allows the network to learn residual functions with reference to the identity mapping, which is easier to optimize than learning the complete transformation directly.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure2.png}
\caption{ResNet-18 Architecture showing the residual blocks and skip connections.}
\label{fig:resnet18}
\end{figure}

The ResNet-18 architecture consists of an initial 7×7 convolutional layer with 64 filters and stride 2, followed by a 3×3 max pooling layer with stride 2. These initial layers reduce the spatial dimensions while capturing basic features. The subsequent layers are organized into four modules, each containing multiple residual blocks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Module 1: Two residual blocks with 64 filters each
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Module 2: Two residual blocks with 128 filters each
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Module 3: Two residual blocks with 256 filters each
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  Module 4: Two residual blocks with 512 filters each
\end{enumerate}

Each module progressively reduces spatial dimensions while increasing feature channels, enabling the network to capture increasingly complex patterns. The final layers include global average pooling followed by a fully connected layer with 1000 output units (for ImageNet classification).

To tailor ResNet-18 for this specific application, the final fully connected layer of the network was replaced with a custom linear layer. This modification adapts the architecture for binary classification, where the two output nodes correspond to the probabilities of the classes NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. The custom layer computes these probabilities using a softmax activation function, ensuring that the outputs sum to one. By modifying the final layer, the model becomes capable of distinguishing between the two classes based on the extracted features. This approach maintains the pre-trained layers' integrity while optimizing the network for the current task {[}2{]} {[}3{]}.

The transfer learning strategy implemented in this study involves freezing the early layers of ResNet-18 while allowing the later layers to be fine-tuned for pneumonia detection. Specifically, the first two modules (layers 1-4) were frozen, preserving the low-level feature extractors that identify edges, textures, and basic shapes universal to image recognition tasks. The remaining layers were made trainable, allowing them to adapt to the specific characteristics of chest X-rays and pneumonia patterns.

This selective freezing approach offers several advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  It preserves the robust feature extraction capabilities learned from the diverse ImageNet dataset
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  It reduces the number of trainable parameters, mitigating overfitting on the relatively smaller medical dataset
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  It accelerates training by focusing computation on adapting higher-level features relevant to pneumonia detection
\end{enumerate}

The modified architecture can be mathematically expressed as:

f(x) = softmax(W\_fc ·GAP(ResNet\_modified(x)) + b\_fc)

Where x is the input chest X-ray image, ResNet\_modified represents the modified ResNet-18 backbone, GAP is the global average pooling operation, W\_fc and b\_fc are the weights and biases of the final fully connected layer, and softmax is the activation function that produces probability outputs.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \emph{Dataset}
\end{enumerate}

The dataset used in this study comprises chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. The dataset was divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This segmentation ensures robust evaluation of the model's performance by enabling it to learn patterns during training, validate its accuracy on unseen data during validation, and finally assess its generalization on a completely independent test set.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The dataset was meticulously curated by excluding low-quality or unreadable scans, ensuring that only diagnostic-quality images were included. All images were initially screened for quality control by removing scans with suboptimal positioning, poor contrast, or significant artifacts that could compromise interpretation. Subsequently, the images were graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. This rigorous screening process ensured high-quality ground truth labels, which are essential for developing accurate diagnostic models.

As evident from Table~\ref{tab:dataset}, the dataset exhibits a class imbalance with pneumonia cases significantly outnumbering normal cases. This imbalance reflects the real-world distribution in clinical settings where the dataset was collected but poses challenges for model training. Class imbalance can bias the model toward the majority class, potentially reducing its sensitivity to the minority class.

synthetic minority oversampling~(SMOTE) {[}19{]} and weighted loss functions during training, ensuring the model did not bias toward the majority class~(pneumonia). SMOTE creates synthetic examples~of the minority class by interpolating between existing instances, effectively augmenting the dataset~with realistic variations of~underrepresented cases. This approach aligns with recommendations~by Cohen et al. (2020), who emphasized balancing techniques to improve sensitivity~in imbalanced medical~datasets {[}18{]}.

The weighted loss function implemented in this study assigned higher penalties~to misclassifications of the~minority class (normal), forcing the model to pay~more attention to these examples during training. The~weight for each class was inversely proportional to its~frequency in the training dataset, ensuring balanced learning despite the uneven class distribution.Ethical considerations, including~patient anonymization and compliance~with HIPAA guidelines, were strictly adhered to, as~outlined in the WHO's ethical framework~for AI in healthcare~{[}24{]}.

All personally identifiable information was removed from the images before inclusion~in the dataset, and institutional~review board approval was obtained for the use of these~images in research. These~measures ensured that~the study maintained high ethical standards while developing~an AI system with~the potential to improve global~health outcomes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \emph{Preprocessing}
\end{enumerate}

To prepare the dataset for optimal~performance within the ResNet-18 architecture, several preprocessing steps were~carried out:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Image Resizing: Each chest X-ray image~was resized to dimensions~of 224×224 pixels. This step is crucial as ResNet-18's architecture requires a fixed input size. Resizing ensures that~all images are uniform~in dimension, facilitating smooth integration into the pre-trained network and maintaining consistency during model training~and evaluation. The resizing was performed using bilinear interpolation, which~preserves image quality better~than nearest-neighbor interpolation while~being computationally efficient.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Normalization: Pixel intensity values in~the images were normalized
  using~the ImageNet dataset's mean~({[}0.485, 0.456, 0.406{]}) and standard deviation~({[}0.229, 0.224, 0.225{]}). This
  normalization step ensures that the images~align with the
  data~distribution of the pre-trained ResNet-18 model. By scaling
  the~pixel values, this~process enhances the model's ability~to learn features effectively and reduces the risk of
  numerical~instabilities during~training. The normalization was applied
  channel-wise, treating~each chest X-ray as a~three-channel image~to
  maintain compatibility with the pre-trained model.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Tensor Conversion: The images~were converted into
  tensors---multi-dimensional numerical arrays that~PyTorch can
  process~efficiently. This conversion facilitates the seamless handling
  of images as~numerical data, enabling the model to
  perform~computations during both~training and inference~phases~{[}2{]}
  {[}3{]}. The~conversion process~preserves the floating-point precision
  of normalized pixel values while~organizing them in a format optimized
  for GPU~processing.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  Data Augmentation: To enhance the model's robustness
  and generalization capabilities, various data augmentation techniques
  were applied during training. These transformations artificially
  expand the dataset's~diversity by creating~variations
  of~the existing images, helping the model learn invariant features and
  reducing overfitting.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure3.png}
\caption{Data augmentation examples: (A) Original chest X-ray image, (B) chest X-ray after rotation, (C) chest X-ray after scaling, and (D) chest X-ray after translation.}
\label{fig:data_augmentation}
\end{figure}

The rotation~operation used for~image augmentation is~normally done~by
rotating the~image in~the clockwise direction by an~angle between~0
to~360 degrees, which rotates the pixel~of the image frame~and fills~the
area of~the image where~there was no image~pixel. In this work,
the~rotation of~315 degrees~(counterclockwise~45 degrees) was used to
simulate~variations in patient~positioning during X-ray acquisition.
This technique helps~the model become invariant to
orientation~differences, which~are common in clinical~settings.

The scaling~operation is~the magnification or~reduction of frame~size of
the~image, which is another~augmentation technique used. In total, 10\%
of image magnification was applied, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:data_augmentation}(C).
This~transformation simulates variations in the distance~between the
X-ray~source and the patient, resulting in different levels~of
magnification in~clinical practice. By training~on both~original and
scaled versions of the images, the model learns to recognize~pneumonia
patterns~regardless of their~size or~scale~within the chest X-ray.

Image~translation can be~done by either~translating the image in~a
horizontal~(width shift) or vertical direction~(height shift) or in~both
directions. The~original~image was horizontally translated by~10\% and
vertically translated by 10\%, as~illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:data_augmentation}(D). This
augmentation technique simulates variations~in patient centering during
X-ray~acquisition and teaches~the model to be~robust to
positioning~differences. Translation~augmentation is particularly
important for~ensuring that~the model focuses on the radiographic
patterns~rather than their~absolute position within the image frame.

Additional~preprocessing steps~included contrast~enhancement using
histogram equalization, which~improved the visibility~of subtle
features~in the X-rays, and random~brightness adjustments (±15\%) to
simulate~variations in exposure settings across~different X-ray
machines. These techniques collectively~enhance the
model's ability to generalize across diverse~clinical
environments~and imaging protocols.

\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  \emph{Training Process}
\end{enumerate}

The training process for~the ResNet-18 model~was meticulously designed
to ensure~optimal performance in~the task of pneumonia detection. To
begin with, the choice~of the loss function was critical; cross-entropy
loss was~utilized due to its effectiveness in classification~tasks. This
function quantifies the difference between the predicted probabilities
and the actual class labels, providing~a clear metric to guide~the
model's learning~process. For~binary classification, the
cross-entropy loss is defined as

:L(y,~ŷ)~= -{[}y log(ŷ) + (1-y)log(1-ŷ){]}

Where y is the true label~(0 for~NORMAL, 1~for PNEUMONIA) and ŷ~is the
predicted probability. To address~class imbalance, the~loss function was
weighted inversely proportional to class~frequencies, assigning higher
importance~to the minority class. By minimizing this loss, the~model was
encouraged to make accurate predictions consistently.

To~optimize the model's~parameters during training, the
Adam optimizer~was employed with an initial learning rate set~at 0.001.
Adam is renowned for its capability to combine~the benefits of
adaptive~learning rates and momentum. This dual~advantage accelerates
the~convergence process~while preventing oscillations that can~occur
during optimization, ensuring that~the model's
parameters are updated efficiently and effectively. The Adam~optimizer
adapts the learning rate for~each parameter based on the~first and
second moments of~the gradients, making~it well-suited for problems~with
sparse gradients or noisy data.

A learning rate~scheduler was implemented to gradually reduce~the
learning rate as training~progressed. Specifically, a step
decay~approach was used, where the learning rate~was reduced by a factor
of~0.1 after~epochs 4~and 8. This~schedule allows for rapid convergence
in early~epochs followed by fine-tuning in later~epochs,
preventing~overshooting of~optimal parameters as the model
approaches~convergence.

The~actual training was conducted over a~period of 10 epochs, with each
epoch comprising multiple iterations over the training~dataset. A batch
size of 32 was selected, striking a balance between computational
efficiency~and the stability~of the gradient~descent process. Smaller
batch sizes often lead to noisy gradient estimates and unstable
training, while larger batches may converge to~sharp minima with~poor
generalization. The chosen batch size of 32 offers a good compromise,
providing~stable gradient updates while enabling effective~training on
standard GPU~hardware.

During~each iteration, a~batch of images~was processed by~the model,
which~calculated the loss and adjusted its internal weights to
improve~its predictions in~subsequent iterations. The forward pass
computes predictions~for each~image in the batch, while the~backward
pass calculates gradients using backpropagation and updates the model
parameters~according to the Adam optimizer's~rules. This
iterative process~allowed the model to progressively refine its
understanding of the~data and improve its classification~accuracy.

Regularization techniques were employed to~prevent overfitting and
improve generalization. Weight~decay (L2~regularization) with a
coefficient of~0.0005 was applied to all~trainable parameters,
penalizing large weights~and promoting simpler models. Additionally,
dropout with a rate~of 0.5 was implemented before~the final
classification layer, randomly deactivating neurons during training to
prevent~co-adaptation and encourage~robust feature learning.

After~completing each epoch, the model's~performance was
evaluated using a~separate validation dataset. This step~was essential
for monitoring~the model's
generalization~capabilities---its~ability to perform~well on unseen
data. Validation accuracy~was recorded at the end of each epoch,
providing a benchmark to assess~the effectiveness of the training
process. Additionally, this evaluation helped identify potential
overfitting issues, where the model performs~exceptionally well on
training data but fails~to generalize to validation or~test datasets.

An~early stopping mechanism was implemented with a patience of~3 epochs,
automatically halting training if no improvement in validation accuracy
was observed over this period. This technique~prevents unnecessary
computation and mitigates overfitting by~stopping training once the
model's generalization performance plateaus. The~best
model weights (those with the highest validation~accuracy) were saved
during~training and used for the final evaluation.

By incorporating regular~validation checks, the training process~was
designed to ensure that the model achieved a~balanced performance~across
different datasets, ultimately improving its~reliability and
applicability {[}3{]}. The entire training pipeline was implemented
using PyTorch~1.7 and executed on NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPUs, enabling
efficient parallel processing and accelerating the training process.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item
  \emph{Testing}
\end{enumerate}

The final~testing phase aimed to rigorously evaluate the generalization
capability of the trained ResNet-18 model~on an independent test
dataset~comprising unseen chest X-ray images. This dataset was
entirely~separate from those~used during training and validation,
ensuring~an unbiased assessment of the model's
real-world applicability. The test set contained a~diverse range of
cases, including varying~degrees of pneumonia severity, different
patient~demographics, and various imaging~conditions to challenge the
model's~robustness.

The evaluation involved processing each~image through the trained
network~to predict its class as~either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA. During
inference, the preprocessing~steps applied to the test images mirrored
those used during~training, including resizing and normalization.
However, no data augmentation~was applied to test~images, as these
transformations are specifically designed for~training to increase data
diversity rather~than for evaluation.

For~each test image, the~model outputs a probability score~for the
PNEUMONIA class. A threshold of 0.5~was applied to these probabilities
to determine the final classification: images with probability scores
above 0.5 were classified as PNEUMONIA, while~those below were
classified as~NORMAL. This threshold represents~the default decision
boundary that balances~sensitivity and specificity.

To quantify performance, the accuracy score function from
the~sklearn.metrics library was employed. This metric provides~a
straightforward measure by~calculating the proportion of
correctly~classified images out~of the total test~samples:

Accuracy = (TP~+ TN) / (TP + TN + FP~+ FN)

Where~TP (True Positives) represents correctly identified pneumonia
cases, TN~(True Negatives) represents correctly identified normal~cases,
FP~(False Positives) represents normal cases incorrectly classified as
pneumonia, and FN (False Negatives) represents pneumonia cases
incorrectly~classified as normal.

In addition to accuracy, comprehensive performance~metrics were
calculated to~provide a more nuanced evaluation~of the
model's capabilities:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Precision~(Positive Predictive Value): TP /~(TP + FP)
\end{enumerate}

Measures~the proportion of correctly identified pneumonia cases among
all~cases classified as pneumonia.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Recall~(Sensitivity): TP~/ (TP~+ FN)
\end{enumerate}

Measures the proportion of~actual pneumonia cases correctly~identified
by the model.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Specificity: TN~/ (TN + FP)
\end{enumerate}

Measures the proportion of~actual normal cases correctly identified
by~the model.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  F1-score: 2~× (Precision~× Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
\end{enumerate}

Represents the~harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a
balanced measure~of the model's performance.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item
  Area Under the~Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve~(AUC-ROC):
  Evaluates the model's~discrimination ability across
  different threshold settings.
\end{enumerate}

A high accuracy score indicates~the model's
effectiveness in identifying~patterns and making correct~predictions
across diverse imaging scenarios. However, despite achieving~a test
accuracy~of 81.09\%, a noticeable gap persisted when compared to the
validation accuracy of~95.16\%. This discrepancy highlighted potential
overfitting, where the model may~have overly optimized for patterns
specific to the training data, limiting its adaptability to unseen data.

The confusion~matrix was analyzed to identify specific patterns~of
misclassification, revealing that the model had a~higher tendency toward
false positives (normal X-rays classified as pneumonia) than false
negatives (pneumonia X-rays classified as normal). While~this bias
toward overdiagnosis might~be preferable from~a clinical
perspective---as missing pneumonia cases (false negatives) typically~has
more severe consequences than overdiagnosing---it still indicates
room~for improvement in specificity.

This~phase underscored the importance of~diverse and representative
datasets~in developing robust deep learning models for~medical
diagnostics. The performance~gap between validation and test sets
suggests~potential data distribution shifts, where the test~set may
contain more challenging or~atypical cases compared to the validation
set. This observation emphasizes the~need for careful dataset curation
and stratification during model development.

While the results~demonstrate promise, further~refinement is~necessary
to enhance~the model's generalization abilities~and
ensure consistent performance across varying~datasets and clinical
environments. Future improvements could include more sophisticated data
augmentation~techniques, ensemble methods~combining multiple models, or
attention~mechanisms to focus on~clinically relevant regions~of the
X-ray~images.

IV. RESULTS

The performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for
pneumonia detection was evaluated using various metrics, including
training loss, validation accuracy, and the confusion matrix. The
detailed results are as follows:

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure4.jpeg}
\caption{Training Loss over Epochs - The training loss decreases steadily over 10 epochs, indicating effective learning.}
\label{fig:training_loss}
\end{figure}

The training loss over 10 epochs is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:training_loss}. It demonstrates a steady decline, converging to approximately 0.02 by the 10th epoch, indicating effective optimization of the model parameters. The consistent decrease in loss implies that the model effectively learned the patterns in the training data without significant overfitting.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure5.jpeg}
\caption{Validation Accuracy over Epochs - The validation accuracy fluctuates, with the highest value exceeding 93\% but showing inconsistencies across epochs.}
\label{fig:validation_accuracy}
\end{figure}

The validation accuracy is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:validation_accuracy}, showing significant fluctuations across epochs. The validation accuracy peaks above 0.93 in certain epochs but drops significantly in others. The red dashed line represents the test accuracy of 85\%. These variations highlight that while the model performs well overall, there might be inconsistencies in generalization across batches, likely due to imbalanced data or model sensitivity.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/figure6.jpeg}
\caption{Confusion Matrix - The matrix highlights strong pneumonia detection but a relatively weaker performance for normal cases.}
\label{fig:confusion_matrix}
\end{figure}

The confusion matrix in Fig.~\ref{fig:confusion_matrix} provides insight into the classification performance of the model. The model successfully identified 386 pneumonia cases, with only 4 misclassifications as normal, demonstrating high sensitivity (recall = 0.9897) for detecting pneumonia.

However, the model's performance in detecting normal cases is relatively weaker, with only 146 correctly classified and 88 misclassified as pneumonia (precision = 0.8143, recall = 0.6239).

This discrepancy suggests that the model is biased toward identifying pneumonia, potentially due to an imbalance in the dataset.

The classification report, shown in Table~\ref{tab:classification}, provides further details about the model's performance:

V. DISCUSSION
\end{quote}

The PneuX-net Pneumonia Detection System exemplifies the transformative
potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics, specifically for
pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. This section discusses the
key insights, performance outcomes, limitations, and potential future
applications of the developed model.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Key Insights and Performance Analysis}
\end{enumerate}

The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of using a
pre-trained ResNet-18 model for pneumonia detection, highlighting its
ability to process chest X-ray images and classify them into NORMAL and
PNEUMONIA categories with promising accuracy. The incorporation of
transfer learning enabled the model to leverage pre-trained features
from the ImageNet dataset, which significantly expedited the training
process and improved performance metrics, particularly validation
accuracy. Validation accuracy peaked at 95.16\%, showcasing the model's
ability to generalize well on validation data. However, the test
accuracy of 81.09\% revealed a performance gap, suggesting room for
improvement in handling unseen data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \emph{Comparison with Existing Methods}
\end{enumerate}

Compared to traditional radiological practices and early Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) systems, the ResNet-18 model brings advanced feature
extraction capabilities, enabling it to outperform conventional
approaches. Unlike models such as DenseNet or EfficientNet, ResNet-18
was selected for its simplicity and computational efficiency, making it
accessible for deployment in resource-constrained environments. While
other studies have achieved higher accuracies using more complex
architectures, this research highlights that lightweight models,
combined with transfer learning, can still deliver impactful results
with appropriate preprocessing and optimization.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \emph{Limitations}
\end{enumerate}

Despite its robust performance, the ResNet-18 model is not without
limitations. One of the primary challenges observed was the noticeable
gap between validation and test accuracy, suggesting potential
overfitting. This issue highlights the need for more diverse and
representative datasets to improve robustness across varying imaging
conditions and patient demographics. Additionally, the lack of extensive
data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and zooming,
may have constrained the model's generalization capabilities. Finally,
the "black-box" nature of deep learning models like ResNet-18 poses
interpretability challenges, which can hinder clinical trust and
adoption.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \emph{Future Directions}
\end{enumerate}

Future work should focus on expanding the dataset to include diverse
imaging modalities and patient demographics, which will enhance the
model's generalization abilities. Incorporating advanced data
augmentation techniques can further improve robustness against
overfitting. Additionally, integrating explainable AI methods, such as
activation maps or attention mechanisms, will enhance model
transparency, fostering trust among clinicians. Finally, exploring
lightweight architectures optimized for mobile devices could enable
field diagnostics and real-time applications in underserved areas,
paving the way for multi-disease detection frameworks to address broader
healthcare challenges.

\section{CONCLUSION}

In this study, we developed and evaluated a deep learning system for
pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using a pre-trained
ResNet-18 architecture. The model achieved promising~results with a
validation accuracy of 95.16\% and a test~accuracy of 81.09\%. This
performance demonstrates the potential~of transfer learning in medical
image analysis, particularly for resource-constrained environments where
radiological expertise may be limited.

The discrepancy between validation and test performance highlights
important~challenges in developing robust AI systems for clinical
applications. Despite these limitations, our findings contribute to the
growing evidence~supporting CNN-based approaches for pneumonia
screening. Future work~should focus on developing more diverse training
datasets, implementing advanced regularization techniques, and exploring
hybrid architectures to~improve generalization across varied clinical
settings.

Our research~underscores both the promise and challenges of AI-assisted
pneumonia diagnosis, with implications for improving healthcare access
in~underserved regions. As these technologies mature, continued focus on
explainability, fairness, and clinical integration will be essential
to~translate algorithmic performance into meaningful patient impact.
